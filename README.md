# 3DEngine

Created for self-study of 3D matrix transformations. The shown sample uses a cube but any 3D object can be represented by the program to
be transformed by rotations and transformations. The program was built from "scratch" using JDK 8, without Java3D, and no 3rd party graphics libraries.
